Source code structure - from https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_source_code
-----------------------

The source code can be divided into sections. Files and functions within the
source code have one- or two-letter prefixes to denote their subsystem.

AM_*
    Automap code
D_*
    Initialisation/general code
F_*
    "Finale" (end of game) and "screen melt" code.
G_*
    Main game loop/control
HU_*
    Heads-up display
I_*
    System-specific code
M_*
    Miscellaneous (includes the menu)
P_*
    Game logic/behaviour
R_*
    Rendering engine
S_*
    Sound code
ST_*
    Status bar
V_*
    General graphic rendering
WI_*
    End-of level "intermission" screen
W_*
    WAD file loading
Z_*
    Zone memory allocation system

The following are common prefixes for functions, although they do not denote a
particular subsystem, and there are no files with these prefixes:

A_*
    Action functions invoked in sprite movement frames (these are the functions
    used in DeHackEd "code pointers")
PIT_*
    Callback functions passed to P_BlockThingsIterator (see p_maputl.c)
T_*
    "Thinker" functions set to be called each clock tic for some purpose (eg,
    moving platforms or flickering lights)

A detailed list of files and their purposes can be found in Doom source code
files.
